## Design and Analysis of a vaccine carrying UAV

##### Problem Statement
The objective is to design a UAV that can be used for the transportation and distribution of vaccines in rural areas and remote locations from a central warehouse.
The constraints & challenges are as follows:
  1. It should be able to carry 10 kg of cylindrical vaccine bottles of 4 cm in diameter and 10 cm height and weight = 50 gm
  2. Flying range ~ 10km
  3. No contamination while carrying vaccines
  4. Cargo temperature should be 2-8 Â° celsius to maintain the cold chain
  5. Automated loading/unloading

##### Design Approach
 - For flying range of approximately 10 kms
